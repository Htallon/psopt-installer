Installation scripts for PSOPT [1]

Currently supported: Debian Wheezy [2] natively, Ubuntu 12.04 [3]
natively and Windows 7 [4] with MinGW/MSYS [5] and TDM-GCC [6]

The three scripts dwpis.sh, uppis.sh and wmpis.sh are used to install
PSOPT in Debian, Ubuntu and Windows respectively.


Installation on Debian
======================

As a prerequisite, the user must be in the groups sudo and staff.

Usage:
In a shell on Debian do the following:
# ./dwpis.sh


If you do not have downloaded the script yet, do:
# wget https://raw.github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/master/dwpis.sh
# chmod a+x dwpis.sh
# ./dwpis.sh

In both cases follow the instructions (enter password for sudo twice)


Installation on Ububtu
======================

Usage:
In a shell on Ububtu do the following:
# ./uppis.sh

If you do not have downloaded the script yet, do:
# wget https://raw.github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/master/uppis.sh
# chmod a+x uppis.sh
# ./uppis.sh


Installation on Windows
=======================

This installation relies completely on Open-source-software, no
compiler from Microsoft is needed.

OpenBLAS [7] is used as replacement of the Blas Reference
Implementation.

It was only tested on Windows 7, but should work on other flavors as
well.

PSOPT will be installed in the directory where the script is executed.

You may uninstall it by deleting the directory it was installed into.

MSYS
----

Get the MinGW/MSYS Installation tool mingw-get-setup.exe from [5].

Install it in the directory $MinGWInstallDir
of your choice (should not have whitespaces) with these packages:
- msys-base
- msys-wget
- msys-unzip
- mingw-developer-tooklitm.

TDM-GCC
-------

For 64-bit support a 64 bit version of MinGW is needed.  According to
the IPOPT recomentation download tdm-gcc-webdl.exe from [6].  Follow
the installation instructions and install it in the directory
$InstallationPathOfMinGW64 of your choice (must be different from
$MinGWInstallDir)

->Create ->select MinGW-w64/TDM64 (32-bit and 64-bit)

Select the following components to install:
- gcc -> core
- gcc -> c++
- gcc -> fortran
- gcc -> openmp
- binutils
- mingw64-runtime
- mingw32-make: no
- gdb: optional
- Menu items: optional
- Add to PATH: no

In the directory $MinGWInstallDir/msys/1.0/etc/ copy fstab.sample to
fstab and change in this file the lines
---
c:/mingw		/mingw
c:/ActiveState/perl	/perl
---
to
---
$InstallationPathOfMinGW64		/mingw
#c:/ActiveState/perl	/perl
---

Gnuplot
-------

Usage of Gnuplot is optional but supported.

Get the latest version from http://www.gnuplot.info/ and install it.
Be sure to include the gnuplot executable into the path - the
installer has an option for this.

Installation
------------

During the installation process several software packages are
downloaded and compiled so be aware that it will take some time. On a
test computer it lasts about 60 minutes.

Start a msys shell (can be found in $MinGWInstallDir\msys\1.0\msys.bat)
user@computer:~$ cd installation_dir
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ wget -O psopt-installer.zip --no-check-certificate https://github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/archive/master.zip
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ unzip psopt-installer.zip
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ ./psopt-installer-master/wmpis.sh

Usage
-----

In the directory 'installation_dir' there will be an example-project
'obscacle' from the PSOPT-examples dir. The accompanying Makefile
should help you get started to create your own projet.

Known issues
============

On Debian some examples do not give the expected results.
On Ubuntu the display of gnuplot charts does not happen automatically.
On Windows Gnuplot does not get installed
